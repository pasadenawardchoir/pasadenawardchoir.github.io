### Call for feedback

This last year was such a blast. Thank you everyone for your voices and hearts. In my effort to better support you all, I’ve put together a short little survey about what could make this new year even better. Please check it out here: <https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/NBXB2BZ>. It will stay up all month for those who need the time.

### Choir this week @ 9am 

We’ll meet and practice before church at 9am this week. This could very well be the permanent time for choir practice this year, but that won’t be decided until the survey results are in (this issue is the very first question). I’m excited to see you there!
